I'm William, and wanting to start fresh on coding, I decided to try and build some skill with new projects after putting aside my old github account.

This account is currently pretty empty and only has a small number of personal projects. I'll write more here as I develop my skill at Java.

You can reach me at my email wmcdermott.math@gmail.com if you have some reason to.
